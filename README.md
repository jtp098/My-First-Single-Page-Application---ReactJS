Hi there and welcome to my first ReactJS project. Please take note that I have utilized a few different components in this project including the below

- React Router dom for the links 
- Axios for my ajax calls 
- Material CSS for my styling

##API KEY is included as a comment in the video!
## Step 1:  npm init

Open CMD, cd to the location you unzipped the project to and run npm init. Just hit enter for all the questions, until it is done. No need to answer the questions

## Step 2:  npm install

Install modules using npm install. This will load up all the dependencies from the package.json file

Summary: 

"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "newsapi": "^2.4.0",
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.8"
  },

## Step 3: 

Open the Ajax.js file and add the news api key submitted separately. 

There are two calls you need to update the initial and then the interval.

## Step 4: npm start

Once this is complete confirm you’re in the right directory and use npm start to run the dev server and load the page

Enjoy!


This next stuff is just standard Boiler plate for React. NO NEED to read further. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
